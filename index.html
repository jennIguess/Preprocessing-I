    <div class="about"><span>I'm the boy who lived</span>
      <p class="story"> I grew up an unwelcome orphan, living with my aunt and uncle in Little Whinging. One day just before my eleventh birthday, an owl tried to deliver a mysterious letter—the first of a sequence of events that resulted in meeting a giant man named Hagrid. Hagrid explained my history to me: When I was a baby, the Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, attacked and killed my parents in an attempt to kill me; because I alone had the power to extinguish The Dark Lord. This illustrates that I've literally been vanquishing evil since I was born. I'm pretty much a natural. </p>
